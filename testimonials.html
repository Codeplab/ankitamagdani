                    <p>I was Ankita’s client for a few months and I noticed significant change after our therapy sessions. I came to Ankita with specific requests and by the end of our therapy I could see improvements in these specific areas. Ankita is a professional and competent specialist who is able to help clients with the help of different types of therapy, including cognitive behavioural therapy and hypnotherapy.</p>
                    <p>In my specific case we were using hypnotherapy and this approach turned out to be very effective - on each session Ankita skilfully guided me through the process, and I could see that my depressive thoughts, anxiety, and tension were relieved. I am happy with the results we were able to achieve and I genuinely recommend Ankita as a psychotherapist to anyone who is struggling with their mental health</p>

                    I was so lucky to meet Ankita earlier this year. I've done therapy few years back, but it was a time for another upgrade. Ankita is patient and caring therapist. under Ankita's careful guidance and support I have achieved all the goals that we set together and sorted other situations which occurred along the way. I was given effective tools for becoming my own therapist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  If I compare myself now and 6 months ago I must say I'm a completely different person today. P.S. Sometimes our sessions were fun too :)

                    I have had the pleasure of working with Ankita and she truly helped me figure out a way to balance work and fun. My goal was to attain more balance so that I could still increase my productivity but also bring more enjoyment into my life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I can honestly say that I have achieved that. Ankita helped me to create two different minds so to speak. Instead of fighting a constant battle I now have dedicated time for joyous activities and clear times for productivity.

                    I've had the pleasure of knowing Ankita as we started working together recently. There's so much I've learnt from her in a short span of time. Given her expertise in the field of Mental Health, she brings a lot to the table. Her knowledge on human behavior is excellent.                  </p>

                  <p>
                    From someone (me) who had no faith in the work of a psychologist and their importance in mental health. Ankita truly changed my perspective and showed me the importance of someone who is a professional in this field.
                    Words and guidance is truly a work of art, and Ankita has proved to be a master of this art various times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I had no direction and was uncertain of many things that were lying low in my subconscious, which was brought to my conscious self with the right words, questions and guidance, all of which Ankita patiently and thoughtfully helped me with. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I highly recommend her expertise to those looking to find answers to various stages of their life at any given age. From career advice, to ones own personality, she truly covers all extents of one’s mental health and the choices they have made, to help them have a better tomorrow.

                    Ankita is a wonderful coach to work with. She was able to quickly assess my career goals, needs, and aspirations and worked with me to put a plan in place that included making significant yet important changes to my LinkedIn profile and my resume. I am sure our sessions have guided me down the right path and will indefinitely help me find better opportunities in the future.
